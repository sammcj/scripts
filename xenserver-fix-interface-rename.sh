# The purpose of this script is to easily run interface-rename on XenServer in order to order the network interfaces in a common
# way on all pool members. This typically gets run after a fresh install of XS, as it usually picks up the NICs on the HP
# blades in the wrong order.
# This script could be injected into the XS installer ISO as until the interfaces are in the correct order, network connection is
# impossible. Therefore it would be useless for this to go into puppet or any other form of post-install automation.
